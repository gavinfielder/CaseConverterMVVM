# CaseConverterMVVM

An educational exercise that implements MVVM pattern in a simple WPF application. This app lets the user input a string in pascal case, camel case, or any string of words separated by spaces. It then converts the string to the other two structures.

I put this together both as a WPF/XAML refresher and to learn MVVM, with some help from [The World's Simplest C# WPF MVVM Example](https://www.markwithall.com/programming/2013/03/01/worlds-simplest-csharp-wpf-mvvm-example.html).
